# internship-approve-purchase
Solution to the prime internship task about a tool for approving purchases in a firm with 4 levels of management.
In short, the solutions that I offered mostly refer to avoiding the repetition of code in canApprove method by a new class that deals only with approval. 
Also, there is a new class responsible only for generating output.
